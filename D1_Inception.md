## Introduction

We are creating a web application for people that play dungeons and dragons. Specifically this web app will be most useful for Dungeon Masters. Our web app will include a Random generator for characters, worlds, and maps. This application will also have note taking capabilities, specifically for names, stats, race, description, class, and an option to enter a precreated character or randomly generate a character. Additionally there will be an initiative tracker and a monster generator.

This project is designed and focused on creating an easily usable application to help streamline and improve the workflow of Dungeon Masters in tabletop roleplaying games. One of the hardest parts of being a dungeon master is remaining organized, keeping track of characters, quests, ect. There are tons of resources that do just one thing in particular, and while it is nice, during actual play and preparation, it involves a lot of bloat. The goal of this software is to help keep users organized, as well as having a single place to both actively create, generate, and run their games.

  

## Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segments

  

Value Proposition:

-   Cosmos Smithy, a place for Dungeon Masters to create, generate, and organize, and run their games, all in one place.
    

Target Customer:

-   Dungeon Masters
    

  

## Interviews

  

Brandon Visoky interviewed Ryan Joplin, a dungeon master, on 2/9/2020. Ryan as a whole said he mainly used programs online for the preparation part of his games, avoiding it while running because of how slow and clunky it can be during a fact paced game. He liked most of our general ideas and outline for the program, adding a couple of features he might like (Soundboard, Dice Roller, Statblock Editor).

Our hypotheses that were validated were that he thought that web apps are far too clunky, and while some are very good at what they do, they are far too specific to warrant using in a live session. He sounded like he would benefit greatly using an app to run his games if it was focused and easy to navigate. His overall thoughts is that it is Nice to have.

Representative Quotes:

“I can keep track of pages in a notebook better than I can keep track of 15 tabs on the internet.”

Brandon Visoky interviewed Blake Stillwell, a dungeon master, on 2/10/2020. Blake as a whole uses his laptop for running and organizing every part of his Dungeon and Dragons games, but when I interviewed him he seemed to be indifferent, saying that he already had a program he used for every part of the game. It might be helpful to have an actual product he can actually look at, that does everything all in one location. When asked about this again, he saw the validity of having one location for everything.

Our hypotheses that were validated were that several of our ideas have not been done before in one place, and he was able to see the usefullness of each of them, despite not being actively interested in using them.

Representative Quotes:

“Seems fine, but I already have something for all of those.”

Brandon Visoky interviewed Nelson Voldeng, a dungeon master, on 2/9/2020. Nelson has only been a dungeon master for about a month, despite being a player for several years. Going into the interview he admitted he was pretty overwhelmed with a lot of different resources and was never sure what to use. He mentioned that having one place to store everything would be incredibly helpful for him since he currently uses a notebook, and despite keeping tabs in it, it is not very searchable.

The main hypothesis confirmed by Nelson was that having a handy piece of software that was able to be used by new players would make the game far easier to run. This may be especially helpful in a market that is growing faster than ever.

Melissa Peiffer interviewed Connor Broderick on February 2/3/2020. Connor shared that he originally kept track of campaign information with pre-designed character sheets. However, the sheets were easy to lose. Since then, he has migrated to using excel and google drive. Excel allowed him to lookup important information easily and efficiently. Connor stated that when creating a character as a player, he tended to spend most of his time reading over the rulebook and planning out the very fine details. As a DM, however, Connor tended to gravitate toward online generators when making his npcs to save time. Connor mentioned that the most time-consuming part of planning campaigns was the character and map creation. Some key insights he provided was that he finds certain things universally useful for campaigns, regardless of what rpg game and ruleset someone is following. These universally useful things would be a place to track items /equipment, a place to track your current level and xp, map editors, a place to keep track of your stats/hp, and a place to keep track of your skills. The hypothesis that was validated was that it is desirable to have information centralized and easy to access. His overall thought was that the app would be nice to have.

Representative Quotes:

“It is useful to have things organized well. If I learn a new combat feature, being able to find where the heck the list of combat features are is very helpful.”

“Otherwise drafting those maps on paper, or god save us just remembering them in my head and then using a physical board is tough. It’s nice to have it all prepared and saved.”

Melissa Peiffer interviewed Rebecca Peiffer on 2/3/2020. Rebecca shared that she normally keeps track of campaign information with google drive, word documents, and spreadsheets. The benefit of this method is that everything is centralized and easy to find. The drawback is that these tools are not made specifically for rpg campaigns. Rebecca said that any character creation she did was always manual. Rebecca has never DM’d, but she said that if she had to guess, the most time-consuming part of it would probably be designing/balancing fights to be the right amount of challenging for the players. The hypothesis that was validated was that having an app tailored more specifically for rpg players would be useful. Her overall thought was that the app would be nice to have.

Representative Quotes:

“For our previous campaigns I think we used paper sheets, which was really challenging if we lost them.”

“We normally just pull up a word document, but it can be difficult to organize everything on a blank canvas.”

Travis Flake interviewed Eric H, a dungeon master, on 2/15/2020. Eric said that he does enjoy using some online tools to prepare resources for the games, but does not use any application typically during the game, as managing resources during the game can be difficult if they are spread out across multiple tabs. He likes the idea of this application, and did not have any ideas for further additions to the app. Our hypothesis was validated in that Eric requested character management tools to make games easier, which is one of the goals of our application. He also validated our belief that web applications currently available to perform actions during the game are rather scattered and require many tabs to do basic tasks during the game. He believed overall it would be Nice to Have this application

“It would be neat to have some additional tools for the game

Hannah Park interviewed Daniel Mercado, a Dungeon Master, on 2/13/2020. He plays Dungeons and Dragons once a week, and uses multiple already existing programs to organize his games. He mentioned that he programs he uses do not lack anything significant, but would definitely appreciate a better way to take notes during and after his games. He seemed to be interested in the random generator, but would be far more convinced about how useful it would be once he actually has the product in his hands. Overall, he seemed to think the product had uses, but none that he would necessarily need.

  

Representative Quotes:

  

“The random generator is a cool idea, but I like coming up with characters and inventing worlds”

Hannah Park interviewed Ricky Jena, a Dungeon Master, on 2/13/2020. During his interview he talked about how he uses a notebook to organize his games, and while nice, it can be unorganized and become quite complicated to search through everything. He thought that a note taking section would be really useful since he can just search for keywords and not have to worry about flipping through pages.

Since he only plays a couple times a year, he found the idea of a generator for everything to be especially useful, since when he wants to play, he does not necessarily want to spend a lot of time doing prepwork. Overall, our hypothesis that a note taking section combined with a random generator would be very helpful to those that do not have the time or will to meticulously go over every detail of their campaign.
