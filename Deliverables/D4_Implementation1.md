### Implemented Requirements

----------

  
  
  

User Stories:

-   “As a Dungeon Master, I want a way to design and build combat encounters so that they are easily accessible while I am running the game.”
    
-   As a writer, I want to be able to take notes on my story and have locations, characters, and story ideas easily accessible from one place, so that writing becomes more efficient.”
    
-   “As a Dungeon Master, I want a way to create and remember my characters stats and abilities.”
    
-   “As a Dungeon Master, I want a way to create and remember my characters stats and abilities.”
    
-   “As a player, I want to easily track numerical information about my characters”
    
-   “As a player I want to be able to edit my characters so that they reflect the changes they experience throughout the game.”

### Adopted technologies

----------

  

-   We adopted React as our main technology for this project as it was something none of us were familiar with, and is widely used in industry. It allows us to make a more interactive website and to have the functionality we need for some of our User Stories to work fluidly and properly.
    

  

### Learning/Training

----------

  
  

-   Some of us were also unfamiliar with local use of Node js and npm, and had to speak with other more knowledgeable team members to get a functional testing environment using npm.
    
-   All of us have taken CS212, so we were all decently familiar with web app basics.
    
-   For the most part, most of this deliverable was spent learning how to use react and understand the functionality of different Javascript libraries. Most knowledge was passed on from team member to team member, but many LinkedIn Learning videos were also watched in order to gain a more solid grasp on the overlying concepts.

We had multiple issues getting our Docker container to upload to AWS. After fixing errors, AWS says we are all good, but the link to the website is nonfunctioning.

  

### Licensing

----------

  
  

-   For our license for Cosmos Smithy, we adopted the GNU General Public License v3.0. We chose this license so that no one would be able to sell our product as a closed source version, should we ever deliver a fully functioning piece of software.

### Look & Feel

----------

  
  

-   Cosmos Smithy has a slick futuristic design that is simple and easily understandable to the user.
    
-   None of us are design experts, but we tried our best to have an uncluttered page with only the necessary parts for functionality available. Each individual page does exactly what it claims it will do, and nothing more. Each page also links back to the homepage, and has quick links to other pages.

### Lessons Learned

----------

  
  
  

-   Some features of an online web application are harder to implement. In future releases, we plan on hosting journal entries and other user data on the server side instead of requiring exporting to keep user journals after page exit.
    
-   React can be more specific in regards to what you put into a function. For instance, the use of arrow functions in javascript as the declaration of a variable is not allowed. Knowing that React is pickier about syntax, we will be using simpler function design going forward.
